# Rock, Paper, Scissor, Lizard, Spock

This second project's web page is a funny game with some references to The Big Bang Theory from where I discovered for the first time this implementation of the traditional game. 

In this site I wanted to show how to apply the logic rules behind rock,paper,scissor game using javascript giving to the user the possibility to plsy as many game they want having an opponent always ready, the computer, using a random choice funvtion, so unpredicable that make the game funnier.
